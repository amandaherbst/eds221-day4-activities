## Part 1. For loops revisited

### Task 1

\
Create two sequences, one called `weekdays` that contains days of the week (\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", etc.) and one called `transects` that contains the series of transect names \"Transect A\", \"Transect B,\"Transect C\". Write a nested for loop that creates a matrix containing the following:

|                        |                        |                        |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| Monday - Transect A    | Monday - Transect B    | Monday - Transect C    |
| Tuesday - Transect A   | Tuesday - Transect B   | Tuesday - Transect C   |
| Wednesday - Transect A | Wednesday - Transect B | Wednesday - Transect C |
| Thursday - Transect A  | Thursday - Transect B  | Thursday - Transect C  |
| Friday - Transect A    | Friday - Transect B    | Friday - Transect C    |
| Saturday - Transect A  | Saturday - Transect B  | Saturday - Transect C  |
| Sunday - Transect A    | Sunday - Transect B    | Sunday - Transect C    |

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
transects <- c("Transect A", "Transect B", "Transect C")
```

```{r}
transect_days <- matrix(nrow = length(weekdays), ncol = length(transects))

for (i in seq_along(transects)) {
  for (j in seq_along(weekdays)) {
    k <- paste(weekdays[j], "-", transects[i])
    transect_days[j, i] <- k
  }
}
```

```{r}
transect_days
```

## Part 2. Functions introduced

### Task 2

Write a function called `force` that calculates a force (in Newtons), given inputs of mass (in kg) and acceleration (in ms2��2 (recall: F=ma�=��), and returns a statement \"The resulting force is \_\_\_ Newtons.\"

```{r}
force <- function(mass_kg, acceleration_ms2) {
  calc_force <- mass_kg * acceleration_ms2
  print(paste("The resulting force is", calc_force, "Newtons"))
}
```

```{r}
force(mass_kg = 2, acceleration_ms2 = 2)
```
